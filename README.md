# Enumerate-Site

A webextensions add-on
([Firefox]()
or [Chrome]()) to obtain search results directly from the URL bar for a
search confined to the site within the currently active tab.

No need to first go to the search results page (unless you need
more results and their descriptions, etc., in which case, that
is also made available).

For a generic search with results added to the URL, see
[Enumerate](https://github.com/brettz9/enumerate).

## Instructions

3. Use the arrows or mouse to select one of the search results to
    go directly to that page.

## Credits

- Inspired by the work of the Firefox add-on [CyberSearch](http://cybersear.ch/)

## Possible to-dos

1. Populate results based on Mediawiki API (where headers could advertise
    Mediawiki support?)
